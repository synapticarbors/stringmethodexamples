Obtaining the code
------------------

If you have `Mercurial`_ installed, you can clone the repository using::

    $ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/joshua.adelman/stringmethodexamples

Alternatively, you can download a compressed archive of the code by going to 
https://bitbucket.org/joshua.adelman/stringmethodexamples/downloads and selecting the ``Branches`` tab
and selecting one of the archive formats for the ``default`` branch.

Dependencies
------------

This code makes use of a number of freely available third-party libraries. You must first install 
WESTPA (http://chong.chem.pitt.edu/WESTPA) and all of its dependencies. This package also makes 
use of several additional libraries for analyzing data generated by the simulations:

    * `bottleneck`_
    * `pymbar`_

It is generally recommended to use either the `Enthought Python Distribution`_ (Academic) or the `Anaconda`_ 
distribution (CE or Pro) to install all of the basic dependencies. Then install `bottleneck`_ and `pymbar`_
either into that version of python or into a separate directory that is on the ``PYTHONPATH``.
The code assumes that the dependencies are available through the python executable returned by ``which python``,
and that you are using a bash based shell on a Unix system (both Linux and OS X should work).


Setup
-----

A Makefile is provided to build all of the python extension included in the package and setup the 
run scripts, environmental variables and symbolic links. First set ``$WEST_ROOT`` to the directory 
containing the `WESTPA`_ package::

    $ export WEST_ROOT=<path to WEST-PA install>

and then run make::

    $ cd stringmethodexamples
    $ make
